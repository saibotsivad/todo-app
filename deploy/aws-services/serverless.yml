# These are the services, in this approach I am envisioning basically only
# a handful of services, namely a DynamoDB table called directly from the
# Cloudflare Worker.

# However, to implement autocomplete text search, you would probably launch an ElasticSearch
# instance or something, and use DynamoDB Streams to pipe data to it, and ideally the Streams
# and ES instance would all be managed here. Or multiple serverless folders, whatever makes sense.
