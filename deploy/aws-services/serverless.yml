# These are the services, in this approach I am envisioning basically only
# a handful of services, namely a DynamoDB table called directly from the
# Cloudflare Worker. However, to implement autocomplete text search, you
# would probably launch an ElasticSearch instance or something, and ideally
# that would be managed here as well.

# TODO also if you want to do streaming from DynamoDB
